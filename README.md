### Detects missing data group lists in iRules
This is to prevent a bug in one of the v12 versions.

### Prevents saving of data group lists when edit has been used
This is to prevent people from clicking edit, forgetting to re-add the edited data and clicking submit causing the element being edited to disappear from the data group list.
